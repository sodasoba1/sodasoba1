now lets build the new theme file by clicking {==BUILD NXTHEME==}

![Switch Layout Editor](<img/sw-lay-ed-sti6.png>)

fill out the *Theme info* by inputting the details into

each of the text boxes `Theme name:` and `Author name:`

!!! Example inline end "Please note"
	It's probably best to keep the name close to the original theme with an identifier it's patched for HOS14.0+

	I try to give the Original Author credit and add myself.

Save the {==.nxtheme==} to a location of your choosing, with a name of your own choosing

`themename-allapps-fix`{==.nxtheme==}

simply transfer the file you have saved onto your switch in the theme location of your choosing on the switch
