??? Question "NX Titles List Dumper :fontawesome-solid-file-csv:"

are you getting Errors importing titles.csv?
lets see if we can fix that.

In NX-GIC go to `File > Settings`

[![nxgic-settings](<img/usingnxgic/settings.jpg>)]{Settings|info}

if you have something in the [`Installed Titles List (CSV)`]{if delete is clickable|rounded|info} path click [Delete]{delete|bottom|rounded|error}.

then click [{==SAVE==}]{SAVE|right|rounded|success}

??? Bug "Possible Bug"
	I recommend closing nx-gic and reopening it, this seems to be better at refreshing the changes made
	I'm not sure if this is a database issue or how nxgic saves changes made to the program

If you have followed by guide you should have titles.csv in the same folder as nx-gic 
copy the path ++ctrl+c++

[![nxgic](img/usingnxgic/bug/csv1.png)]{Copy the Address Bar|info}

once again open NX-GIC go to `File > Settings`

and paste ++ctrl+v++ the nx-gic location we have just copied into [`Installed Titles List (CSV)`]{D:\Switch Icons\NX-Game-Icon-Customizer\titles.csv|bottom|rounded|error}

To Reload titles.csv Click on Auto GIC
Hit Ok and locate the titles.csv file

click open and titles installed should work correctly

	I've noticed errors where nx-gic fails to load the csv correctly and can possibly delete the CSV file from your system
	so either have a backup or recopy the file from your SD card.
