#![add-new](<img/usingnxgic/br-add/add-newbr1.png>)

once you have chosen the image before finding the title ID you *may* need to add the icon name or shorten it to be successful in finding a matching ID

!!! example "&nbsp;"
	in the example I have called the icon Taiko No Tatsujin
	rather than the full name
	#![add-new](<img/usingnxgic/br-add/add-newbr2.png>)

clicking `Find...` you can search via CSV which is a litle of titles installed on the switch
or via JSON which is a online titleID database

choose the game that matches the icon you are adding

#![add-new](<img/usingnxgic/br-add/add-newbr3.png>)

you will now have a updated Icon Name & Title ID check everything is correct and click `Add`

Everything will now be ready as the icon is added to your output window ready for transferring
