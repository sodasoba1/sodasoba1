#Setting Up NX-GIC :material-book-open-page-variant-outline:
!!! info inline start "[Offline Guide here](offlinenxgic.md)" 
[ ]{left} 

[ ]{left} 

if you haven't already download [NX-GIC](https://github.com/hotshotz79/NX-Game-Icon-Customizer).<br>

First Launch
---
When you first launch the program you will need to ```scan``` so you can pull the icon repos

??? example inline end "PLEASE NOTE"
	the icon repo is over 250mb in zip format with over 3100 files extracting can be slow
	
	I have moved Horizontal & Square icons to a seperate repo to save downloading and extracting nx-gic
	
	the process is still a little slow
![nxgic](<img/nx-gic.png>) 



Once complete we will set the switch ip for ftp transfers 
*within NX-CIG*

`File > Settings`

![ip](<img/settings.jpg>)

put your switch ip into the `Switch IP Address` textbox

`UserName` / `Password` credentials 

`SteamGridDB API Key`

[![ip](<img/ip.jpg>)]{Details how to find and setup can be found in the Prerequisites section|info}
!!! bug "1.4.0: CLOSE AFTER SAVING"
		once you have saved all the details be sure to {++Close++} NX-GIC
		and re-open the application before you continue
		
		this will fix the no login credentials found when you first try to open a FTP connection


###Installing NX Title List Dumper :fontawesome-solid-file-csv:

with `sys-ftpd-light` running on the switch lets install NX Title List Dumper from nx-gic

`Title IDs > Install NX Title List Dumper (NRO)`

![nxgic-tid](<img/nx-gic-tid.jpg>)

Follow the instructions on the popup.

[![nxgic](<img/popup1.jpg>)]{If you have followed the steps to adding the IP it will show up on this screen|large|error}

Our Switch IP Should Be here.
hit `yes` and the process will begin

![yes](<img/nx-gic-tid2.jpg>)

hit `yes` you will get a popup 

!!!Warning "Don't click anything yet:"
	leave this pop up open and move to the switch and follow the steps for NX Titles List Dumper
	![yes-popup](<img/nx-gic-tid3.jpg>)

###Using NX Titles List Dumper :fontawesome-solid-file-csv:

Once the nro is transferred  load nx-titles-list-dumper from hbmenu

![nxgic](<img/nxtitledump.jpg>)

![nxgic](<img/nxtitledump2.jpg>)

press :material-alpha-a-circle:{ .btna } to dump your installed title IDs

this will place a file into `SD:/titles.csv` once it's `done` 

press :fontawesome-solid-circle-plus:{ .yes } to exit

once `SD:/titles.csv` is dumped you can click `OK`

![yes-popup](<img/nx-gic-tid3.jpg>)

and hit `ok` in NX-GIC

![ftpd](<img/ok.jpg>)

If everything is sucessful you will see the completed

![cvs-complete](<img/done2.jpg>)

??? Warning "transfer failure?!"
	if the ftp transfer of ***`titles.csv`*** fails (mine unfortunately did)

	place `titles.csv` :fontawesome-solid-file-csv: ___from___ the [`root`]{SDMC:/|success} of your SD card into the same folder as `NX-Game Icon Customizer.exe` 

	![ftpd](<img/yes3.jpg>)

Auto NX-GIC :material-auto-fix:
---

Auto nx-gic can be used automatically select icons based off the installed titleIDs on your switch via `titles.csv`
from the NX Titles List Dumper homebrew

![nxgic](<img/auto-nx-gic.jpg>)

Click on `Auto GIC` to enable it 

then from the drop down select the `style` to match your installed theme

in this example I've chosen *vertical*

now nx-gic will match all of the icons found in titles.csv to icons on the repo

click on `Add All to Output` to add the matching icons to the upload queue

??? inline start Warning "Missing icons?"
	you may notice some icons aren't found or matched this can be due to 1 of 2 reasons
		
	1. The Icon Doesn't exist.
	2. The title ID you have is different from the title ID on the repo (US/EUR/JPN).

  	homebrew forwarders are usually not matched so you will have to manually change the TID in the output section
     you can also add icons individually auto-gic pics the first icon found.
	 
!!! example inline "my repo might have multiple variants for certain games, it might have older variations of a TID for homebrew between different icons"

##Showing Icons Based off TitleID :material-list-status:

 you can show icons matching installed TIDs by clicking

 `Title IDs > show Icons for Installed Games only`

  [![nxgic](<img/gic-showins.jpg>)]{Setting this option will show icons that match what's installed on the switch based off the dumped titles.csv file|large|info}

###View A List of installed Games :material-format-list-checkbox:

 you may also individually look through each icon folder and use the CSV list to match icons
 by clicking 
 
 `title IDs > Show List of Installed Games (CSV)`
 [![nxgic](<img/showcsv.jpg>)]{Use the CSVlist to compare titles with icons|info}

###Editing your Output before tranferring :material-image-edit:

It's possible to edit your output before begining to transfer files to the switch

![nxgic-tidedit](<img/tid.jpg>)

you can edit titleID in the output section just by copying [++ctrl+c++]{copy} the titleID in the CSVlist and pasting [++ctrl+v++]{paste} the over titleID in output with your new titleID.

if your output has a game with a title you're unsure of like a japanese title in the example above

you can click on the {==:material-view-sequential-outline:==}`view` button and the icon will open and show you the image in the queue

:octicons-pencil-24: You can set a `custom title` / `Author` & `Version` which is excellent for Fan translations

editing in NX-GIC will make a config.ini file and place it in the same folder as the custom icon

<code>
[override_nacp]<BR>
name=my custom title name game<br>
author=someone<br>
display_version=X.X.X<br>
</code>

you can see Yo-Kai Watch is renamed from japanese (妖怪ウォッチ) in the example below

[![yokai](<img/yokai.jpg>)]{Yo-Kai Watch Renamed from the japanese title 妖怪ウォッチ}

[![vTheme](<img/notice.jpg>)]{'妖怪ウォッチ' is renamed to 'Yo-Kai Watch' on the homescreen also|info}

This isn't a permanent "rename" it works the exact same way the icon takeover does.

Transferring :material-transfer:
---

!!! info inline start "sys-ftpd-light should be enabled on your switch"
when you are happy with your chosen icon(s) click<br> `transfer`

[ ]{left}

hopfully you have already setup the IP of your switch as previously shown, click the ftp method

[![nxgic](<img/nx-gic5.png>)]{If you clear the queue all the icons you have added to the output will delete after uploading|large|right|warning}

click ```upload``` and you'll see the switch recieve the files, they're automatically transferred to the correct folders based off the titleID
in `SDMC:/atmosphere/contents/[titleid]/icon.jpg`

[![nxgic](<img/nx-gic6.png>)]{If you clear the queue all the icons you have added to the output will delete after uploading|large|right|warning}


once you've finished transferring you will see success in green

!!!Warning "You will need to reboot for icons to refresh"

###Recommended transfer method :material-order-bool-descending-variant:


I recommend using the ftp method over mtp as i personally find ftp to be a lot faster, especially when you are bulk transferring custom icons, that's the method I have always used.
